# University of Damascus Server-Client System Project ( Minimalised Example )

## Overview
This project aims to establish a system to connect a server with clients ( students and professors ). It focuses on the Server-Client Model and ensures confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation of information.

## Features
- **Server-Client Communication**: Uses TCP/IP sockets.
- **Security**: Implements event-driven/multi-threading for handling multiple clients.
- **Data Protection**: Emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, authentication, and authorization.

## Stages of Development
1. **Client Request Handling**: Manages client requests.
2. **Data Confidentiality**: Ensures network data secrecy.
3. **Hybrid Encryption**: Uses PGP.
4. **Digital Signature**: For data integrity and non-repudiation.
5. **Certificate Verification**: Ensures entity authenticity.

## Requirements
- Python
- Knowledge of TCP/IP, PGP, digital signatures, and certificate-based authentication.
